        <div id="debriefingtext">
            <p>Thank you for your participation in our study! Your de-identified data makes an
            important contribution to our understanding of human learning and behavior. </p>

            <p>During this study, we are looking to understand how people learn to cooperate
            with one another. Previous research has shown that people working together tend
            to calibrate their behavior to match their partner's. Our experiment hopes to answer
            whether this calibration can occur even for <i>perceptual</i> or <i>low-level sensory</i>
            behaviors. In other words, we want to see whether you and your partner tended to
            become more similar and more accurate in your estimations of line lengths during
            the course of the experiment.</p>

            <p>If you have any questions about this research or would like to have your
              data withheld from the study, you may contact Dr. Alexandra Paxton at
              <a href = "mailto:alexandra.paxton@uconn.edu" target="_blank">alexandra.paxton@uconn.edu</a>.</p>
