                <p>Before you start playing the game, you'll receive training. In each training round, 3 red lines will appear for 1 second and then disappear. Each red line will have a number next to it. Your goal is to remember all three lines.</p>

            <div class="col-xs-4">

                <p>Two seconds later, you will be told to recreate <i>just one</i> of the lines that you saw as accurately as possible (#1, #2, or #3).</p>

                <p>Move the mouse left and right to adjust the size of the blue bar, and then click to enter your response. You will have 2 seconds to respond.</p>

                <p>During training, a gray bar will appear above your guess for 2 seconds to show you the correct answer.</p>
