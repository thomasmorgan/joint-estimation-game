              <p>Once you've finished the training rounds, you will play the
                game with a partner who has also finished training. Again, your
                goal is to submit the most accurate guess possible.</p>

              <p>At the beginning of each round, you and your partner will be
                shown three red lines. Each line will be numbered. They will
                appear for 1 second and then disappear.</p>

              <p><img src = "/static/images/red_stimuli_bars.png" width = 200px
                alt = "The three lines will always be shown in red.">​</p>

            </div>
            <div class="col-xs-4">

              <p>After waiting for 2 seconds, you will have 2 seconds to
                individually recreate one of the three lines, identified by
                number (#1, #2, or #3). Again, <b>move the mouse</b> left and
                right to adjust the size of the blue bar, and then <b>click</b>
                to enter your response.</p>

              <p><img src = "/static/images/recreate_instructions.png" width = 200px
                alt = "You will be told which of the three lines to recreate now.">​

              <img src = "/static/images/blue_response_bar.png" width = 200px
              alt = "Your guess will always be shown in blue.">​

              <p>After you and your partner have each submitted your first
                guess, you will see your guess (in blue) above your partner's
                guess (in green).</p>

              <p><img src = "/static/images/blue_response_bar.png"
                width = 200px alt = "Your guess will always be shown in blue.">​

              alt = "During testing, your partner's guess will be shown in green.">​
            </p>

            </div>
            <div class="col-xs-4">

                <p>You and your partner will not be able to see the correct
                  answer, but each of you can decide whether to accept your
                  guess or submit a new guess. If either of you submits a new
                  guess, you will both be asked to decide again to accept your
                  guess or submit a new one.</p>

                <p>You and your partner will repeat this until you both decide
                  not to make any additional changes and submit your final
                  guesses.</p>

                <p>After you finish each round, you and your partner will move
                  onto the next round.</p>
