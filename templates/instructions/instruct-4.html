        <p>During the game, you will have the opportunity to earn two bonuses:

        <ul>
            <li><b>Accuracy bonus</b>. You will earn a bonus for submitting more accurate guesses, up to a maximum of $2 for the entire game. (You will earn a greater percentage of that bonus for greater accuracy.) Only the last guess of each game round will be used to determine your bonus.</li>
            <li><b>Completion bonus</b>. You will also earn a flat bonus of $0.33 for completing the entire game, regardless of accuracy.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><b>Remember</b>: You must respond within 60 seconds. If you have not entered your response within that time, your game will time out, and you will only earn the base compensation rate for participation. You will not retain any of the bonuses from any rounds that you have already completed.</p>

        <p>If your partner times out, you will earn the base compensation rate for participation, any accuracy bonuses that you have already earned, and the full completion bonus.</p>
