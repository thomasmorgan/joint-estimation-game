	The ad.html has a very specific format.

	Really there are two "ads" contained within this file.

	The first ad displays to participants who are browsing
	the Amazon Mechanical Turk site but have not yet accepted
	your hit.

	The second part of the ad display after the person selected
	"Accept HIT" on the Amazon website.  This will reload the
	ad and will display a button which, when clicked, will pop
	open a new browser window pointed at your local psiTurk
	server (assuming it is running and accessible to the Internet).

	See comments throughout for hints

							    <p>
									The Cocosci Lab at University of California, Berkeley is looking for
									online participants for a brief psychology experiment. The
									only requirement is that you are at least 18 years old. The task
									will take about 20 minutes. The task will provide base payment of $1,
									but each particiant can earn up to an additional $2.33 in bonuses.
							    </p>
									<p><b>NOTE: If you accept this HIT, you must begin right away,
										as other participants are waiting for you.</b> This experiment
										involves a game that requires two participants to play a game
										with one another in real time.
									</p>
							    <p>
								    Please click the "Accept HIT" button on the Amazon site
								    above to begin the task.
								</p>


							{% else %}

								<!--
									OTHERWISE
									If assignmentid is NOT "ASSIGNMENT_ID_NOT_AVAILABLE"
									it means the participant has accepted your hit.
									You should thus show them instructions to begin the
									experiment ... usually a button to launch a new browser
									window pointed at your server.

									It is important you do not change the code for the
									openwindow() function below if you want you experiment
									to work.
								-->
							    <h1>Thanks for accepting this HIT.</h1>
									<p><b>Please begin immediately.</b> Because this is a two-person game,
										you must start as soon as possible so that you can be connected to
										another player.
									</p>
							    <p>By clicking the following URL link, you will be taken to the experiment,
										including complete instructions and an informed consent agreement.
							    </p>
									<p>
										Because this is a two-person game, you may also be unable to find
										a partner, or your assigned partner may be removed (if they stop playing
										or return the HIT). If you experience any issues with the game, please return
										the HIT and email the requester immediately. Thank you for
										playing!
